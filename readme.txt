QUESTION 2- Performance Improvement

To get the most frequent words two solutions have been developed and located in classes WordFrequencyCountOne(A) and WordFrequencyCountOTwo(B). They both achieve the same results but only one can be used at a time. Solution A uses traditional looping structures while solution B uses latest technology in the form of Linq. Surprisingly, solution A achieved better performance of about 239 Milliseconds compared to solution B which takes 730 Milliseconds. Therefor our preferable solution is A, though the code is long and not easy to trace.
